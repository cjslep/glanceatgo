On September 21, 2007 Go was first discussed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
- _"[...] development at Google is big, can be slow, and is often clumsy."_ -Rob Pike

Frustration with using C++, Java, Python, and other languages:
- Issues of scaling across developers, codebases, and hardware.
- Language design was in totally unrelated environment to today's programming environment.
- Build times on order of minutes to hours, consistently.
- Uncontrolled or runaway dependencies.
- Programmers using different subsets and dialects of the same programming language.
- Programs difficult to read.
- Duplication of effort.
- Cost of updates too high.
- Lack of tools, or too difficult/expensive to build tools.
