* Purpose

Consider programming language choice as one piece of a solution to a technical problem.

* The Tour

An online tour of the language is available at [[http://tour.golang.org/]]:

* The Playground

Play with the language without installing it at [[http://play.golang.org/]]:

* Overview

- Motivation: Why does Go exist?
- The Go Ecosystem
- So What's The Catch?
- Learning Go: What creates the big picture?

* Motivation: Why does Go exist?

* Initial Idea

On September 21, 2007 Go was first discussed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

Frustration with using C++, Java, Python, and other languages.

_"[...]_development_at_Google_is_big,_can_be_slow,_and_is_often_clumsy."_ -Rob Pike

* Issues In The Software Engineering Big Picture

- Languages were designed in unrelated environments.
- Programmers using different subsets and dialects.
- Issues of scaling across developers, codebases, and hardware.
- Build times on order of minutes to hours.
- Uncontrolled or runaway dependencies.
- Cost of updates too high.
- Lack of tools, or too difficult/expensive to build tools.

* Static or Dynamically Typed?

Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google, explored weaknesses in Java and C++.

The Go team initially looked at dynamically typed languages like Lua, Javascript, Ruby.

Desired static-typing instead:

- Proven in practice to create large-scale programs.
- Powerful for experts.

* The Target

- Statically typed
- Comprehensible, "light on the page"
- Fast builds
- Fast to work in
- Doesn't require tools, but supports them well
- Third party code discovery
- Good at networking and _multiprocessing_

* The Target (Paraphrased)

Design a language targeted for software engineers and production systems, not for academic researchers and CS research.

* Brief Timeline on Multicore Processors

C++, Java, and Python rely on libraries to do concurrent programming. 

- Python designed in 1989, first released in 1991
- Java design started in 1991, first released in 1995
- C++ designed in 1979, first standardized 1998

First mass-produced commercial multicore commercial chip was IBM's _POWER4_ chip in 2001. By 2006, Intel (_Core_Duo_) and AMD (_Opteron_) joined with multicore CPUs.

* Language Features

- Mark and sweep garbage collected
- Composition only, no inheritance
- Interface implementation via duck-typing
- Deployment is a single binary
- Concurrency using built in language features
- Cross-compiling with `$GOOS` and `$GOARCH`
- `error` support is built in

* The Go Ecosystem

_"Go:_'get_s[tuff]_done'_language"_ -Brad Fitzpatrick

Unlike other projects (ex: `protobuf`), Google _imports_ the Go project into its organization _from_ the open source community.

The community driven `go` command line tool is designed to be a simple and unobtrusive companion for any gopher.

* The Go Tool

The `go` tool is provided to help the developer but is not required to use.

Makes many things easy to do from the command line:

- *Get*code*
- Build code
- Test code
- Benchmark code
- Format code
- Simple static checking

* The Go Tool: Conventions

When using the `go` tool, the local workspace is set up in the following way:

.code dirSystem.txt /DIR/,/DIREND/

Packages are similar to namespaces in C++, but equate to a single library or executable.

* Packages & Getting Code (cont.)

Let's use an example: *godropbox*.

It is available at: [[http://github.com/dropbox/godropbox][http://github.com/dropbox/godropbox]]

Each directory is its own package. There is no special relationship between a parent and child directory besides keeping things organized.

.image godropbox.png 350 _

* Packages & Getting Code (cont.)

.code dirSystem.txt /GETEX/,/GETEXEND/

Fetches the code remotely and puts it on your local machine. Supported VCS:

- Mercurial
- Git
- Subversion
- Bazaar

Any server can host the code, but the most commonly used websites are:

- github.com
- bitbucket.org
- code.google.com/p

* Packages & Getting Code (cont.)

To use a package:

.code dirSystem.txt /IMPORT/,/IMPORTEND/

That is all it takes to get and use source code!

* Discovering Code: godoc

`godoc` is used to convert documentation to text, HTML, UNIX man page...

The [[http://godoc.org/][godoc.org]] website automatically generates godoc information for libraries publicly available for GitHub, Bitbucket, Launchpad, and Google Project Housing.

Standard library example: [[http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/][http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/]]

*godropbox* example: [[https://godoc.org/github.com/dropbox/godropbox][https://godoc.org/github.com/dropbox/godropbox]]

* Documenting Go Code

To leverage godoc, put comments directly prior to whatever it is being documented:

.code godocSample.go
.image bitVector.png

- Need to put a blank line between comments to start a new paragraph.
- Preformatted text needs to be indented relative to surrounded comment text.
- URLs will be converted to HTML.

* Documenting Go Code

- Documentation can use `/*`...`*/` style.
- Runnable examples can be embedded into the documentation.
- Known bugs can be documented.
- Almost anything can be documented (packages, types, interfaces, functions, etc).

[[https://godoc.org/github.com/fluhus/godoc-tricks][Godoc Tricks]] has many examples.

* The Go Tool Revisited

.code goTool.txt /GET/,/GETEND/
- *Build*code*
- Test code
- Benchmark code
- Format code
- Simple static checking

* Compiling Code

There are two commands:

.code goTool.txt /BUILD/,/BUILDEND/

- If a library, compile but delete output (ensure it compiles)
- If an executable, compile executable to output directory

.code goTool.txt /INSTALL/,/INSTALLEND/

- If a library, compile library to `pkg/OS_ARCH/example.tld/path/to/foo.a`
- If an executable, compile to `bin/`

* Compiling Code (cont.)

Two compilers in Go:

- `gccgo`: Slower compilation, values CPU over concurrency (thread) optimizations, supports OSs that GCC supports.
- `gc`: Faster compilation, values concurrency (coroutines) over CPU optimizations, based on Plan 9 C compiler.

The linker used is based on the Plan 9 linker.

* Compiling Code (cont.)

When using the `go` tool:

- It checks all `import` ed dependencies recursively
- Quits and warns if any circular dependencies are detected
- Rebuilds only packages that have changed or whose dependencies have been rebuilt

So no more setting build dependencies, specifying linker directories, configuring VS project files...

* Tangent: How fast is Go?

[[http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r9&hw=peak&test=json][Techempower]]'s web framework benchmarks provides a variety of tests.

* The Go Tool Revisited

.code goTool.txt /GET/,/GETEND/
.code goTool.txt /BUILD/,/BUILDEND/
.code goTool.txt /INSTALL/,/INSTALLEND/
- *Test*code*
- Benchmark code
- Format code
- Simple static checking

* Testing Code

Testing is done by unit tests which are in files right beside the source code.

When getting the source, the tests can be immediately viewed and run to judge quality.

Test coverage can help determine the quality of the tests.

.code goTool.txt /COVERTEST/,/COVERTESTEND/

* Testing Code (cont.)

Code for testing go in files that end in `_test`

By convention, `foo.go` is tested by `foo_test.go`

* Testing Code (cont.)

.code fooTest.go

* The Go Tool Revisited

.code goTool.txt /GET/,/GETEND/
.code goTool.txt /BUILD/,/BUILDEND/
.code goTool.txt /INSTALL/,/INSTALLEND/
.code goTool.txt /TESTONLY/,/TESTONLYEND/
- *Benchmark*code*
- Format code
- Simple static checking

* Benchmarking Code

.code fooBench.go
.code goTool.txt /BENCHALL/,/BENCHALLEND/

* The Go Tool Revisited

.code goTool.txt /GET/,/GETEND/
.code goTool.txt /BUILD/,/BUILDEND/
.code goTool.txt /INSTALL/,/INSTALLEND/
.code goTool.txt /TESTONLY/,/TESTONLYEND/
.code goTool.txt /BENCHONLY/,/BENCHONLYEND/
- *Format*code*
- Simple static checking

* Formatting Code

Slightly cheating here, as the tool grew to encompass the `gofmt` tool as `go`fmt`.

Automatically formats syntactically valid code into a certain style.

.code gofmtEx.go /PREFORMAT/,/PREFORMATEND/
.code gofmtEx.go /POSTFORMAT/,/POSTFORMATEND/

* Formatting Code (cont.)

The high adoption rate of this tool ensures that there is a high chance you are able to read Go code, because it looks like your code.

_"Code_is_written_once_and_read_many_times."_ - Unknown Pragmatic Programmer

Wikipedia lists a few brace styles:

- Kernel Style
- K&R Style (2 variants)
- Allman Style
- BSD KNF Style
- ...and 7 others

* Formatting Code (cont.)

LLVM's libc++ standard library does not follow one standard. Vector:

.code bracesLLVM.txt

* Formatting Code (cont.)

The Go standard library is run through the format tool. From `crypto/sha512`:

.code bracesGolang.go

* Formatting Code (cont.)

_"Even_if_you_don't_intend_anybody_else_to_read_your_code,_there's_still_a_very_good_chance_that_somebody_will_have_to_stare_at_your_code_and_figure_out_what_it_does:_That_person_is_probably_going_to_be_you,_twelve_months_from_now."_ - From MSDN's Blog in 2007

What did Microsoft release in 2007?

* Formatting Code (cont.)

.code goFmtBraces.go /PRE/,/PREEND/
becomes

.code goFmtBraces.go /POST/,/POSTEND/

* Formatting Code (cont.)

Formatting is a convention, and Go is open-source.

Forking the [[http://golang.org/src/cmd/gofmt/gofmt.go][gofmt]] source is always an option.

But there is a caveat...

* Formatting Code (cont.)

.play syntaxErr.go

* Formatting Code (cont.)

Semicolon injection forces brace style.

BCPL-based injection. _Not_javascript_ .

If at the end of a line it looks like a statement, put a semicolon there.

_"Semicolons,_however,_are_for_parsers,_not_for_people,_and_we_wanted_to_eliminate_them_as_much_as_possible."_ - [[https://golang.org/doc/faq#semicolons][golang FAQ]]

Therefore, this could be a statement:

.code syntaxErr.go /MAYBESTATEMENT/,/MAYBESTATEMENTEND/

* The Go Tool Revisited

.code goTool.txt /GET/,/GETEND/
.code goTool.txt /BUILD/,/BUILDEND/
.code goTool.txt /INSTALL/,/INSTALLEND/
.code goTool.txt /TESTONLY/,/TESTONLYEND/
.code goTool.txt /BENCHONLY/,/BENCHONLYEND/
.code goTool.txt /FMT/,/FMTEND/
- *Simple*static*checking*

* Simple Static Checking

Like `go`fmt`, `go`vet` was adopted from a popular third-party tool.

- Unreachable code
- Useless assignments
- Atomic mistakes (concurrency kind of atomic)
- ...many others

* Simple Static Checking

.code badVet.go
.code vetOut.txt

* The Go Tool Revisited

.code goTool.txt /GET/,/GETEND/
.code goTool.txt /BUILD/,/BUILDEND/
.code goTool.txt /INSTALL/,/INSTALLEND/
.code goTool.txt /TESTONLY/,/TESTONLYEND/
.code goTool.txt /BENCHONLY/,/BENCHONLYEND/
.code goTool.txt /FMT/,/FMTEND/
.code goTool.txt /VET/,/VETEND/

* So What's The Catch?

* Not in Go Version 1.x

An easy-to-use debugger is missing from the ecosystem.

Mitigations:

- `gdb` takes some significant wrangling.
- Print statements everywhere.
- Side effect: a great motivator for writing tests.

* Not in Go Version 1.x

Dynamically linked/loaded libraries are missing. Everything is statically linked.

Mitigations:

- Wait.

* Not in Go Version 1.x

Generic programming (templates). Incredibly controversial.

Mitigations:

- Wait for the `go`generate` command.
- `interface{}` containers and typecasting.
- Custom code generators.

* Learning Go: What creates the big picture?

* Hello World

.play helloWorld.go

* Hello World

.code helloWorld.go

- `package`main` is a special package name for packages containing a main function.
- `import`"fmt"` is similar to the `#include` C++ preprocessor macro.
- The keyword `func` is used to declare a function.
- _"Semicolons,_however,_are_for_parsers,_not_for_people,_and_we_wanted_to_eliminate_them_as_much_as_possible."_ Golang FAQ

* An Expanded Example

.play naiveFact.go /START/,/END/

- Less parentheses.

.play naiveFactBadBrace.go /START/,/END/

* An Expanded Example (w/ Closure)

.play closureFact.go /START/,/END/ HL000

* C/C++ vs Go: Functional Programming

Function type declaration:

- `typedef`int`(*fn)(int,`int)`
- `type`fn`func(int,`int)`int`

* C/C++ vs Go: Functional Programming (cont.)

Function using a function type declaration:

- `typedef`int`(*fn)(int`(*)(int,`int),`int)`
- `type`fn`func(func(int,`int)`int,`int)`int`

* C/C++ vs Go: Functional Programming (cont.)

Function using and returning a function type declaration:

- `typedef`int`(*(*fn)(int`(*)(int,`int),`int))(int,`int)`
- `type`fn`func(func(int,`int)`int,`int)`func(int,`int)`int`

* What about bad input?

.code naiveFact.go //,/END/

* Error Handling

.play closureFactErr.go

* What is an error?

Error is a built in interface in the language:

.code errorDef.go

Any type satisfying all of the function definitions satisfies the interface.

* Creating an error with extra data:

.play metadataError.go /START/,/END/

* Handling the Exceptional without Exceptions

From the `io` package, some lines omitted:

.code ioCopySample.go /STARTIO/,/ENDIO/

* Handling the Exceptional without Exceptions (cont.)

Returning an error as soon as it happens is idiomatic.

.code ioCopySample.go /STARTAPP/,/ENDAPP/

* Handling the Exceptional without Exceptions (cont.)

Handling cleanup would be a problem...

.code ioCopySample.go /STARTAPPCLOSE/,/ENDAPPCLOSE/

* Handling the Exceptional without Exceptions (cont.)

\... but `defer` saves the day.

.code ioCopySample.go /STARTAPPDEFER/,/ENDAPPDEFER/

* Defer any function

.play deferExample.go
